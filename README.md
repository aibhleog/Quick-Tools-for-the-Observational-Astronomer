## Quick-Tools-for-the-Observational-Astronomer
These are some of the quick tools I use while observing and writing proposals.
Mostly they are scripts I've integrated into my .bashrc (which I will describe) so that I can run them from the terminal using keywords -- a wonderfully useful trick.

Be sure to look at `playing-with-your-bashrc.md` for an outline of how to integrate the `python` scripts into your terminal!
##### NOTE: the scripts assume your default `python` is `python 3.6.0`
